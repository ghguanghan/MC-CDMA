1. Only change L2_student.c Put your code between: 
	
	//***Student_code_start*** 
	//    Your code...
	//    ...
        //    ...
	//***Student_code_end*****

   Don't change other code.

2. You need to write all function in L2_student.c

3. Please make sure you have the latest version of "gcc"

4. Compile with command line:
	make tdm
	make fdm

5. Excute with command line.
	./L2_ChEst_TDM_pilot_ofdm 8 5000 2 0

	8: Channel Tap. 5000 simulated block. 2: pilot insert rate 0: No perfect channel estimation
	
	./L2_ChEst_FDM_pilot_ofdm 8 5000 16 lin 0

	8: Channel Tap. 5000 simulated block. 16: number of pilot carriers 
	lin: Interpolation method 0: No perfect channel estimation

6. Plot your graph with any tools you like.
