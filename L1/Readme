1. Only change L1_mccdma.c. Put your code between: 
	
	//***Student_code_start*** 
	//    Your code...
	//    ...
        //    ...
	//***Student_code_end*****

   Don't change other code.

2. You need to write following function:

	void pn_generator(char* pnSequence, int len)	

	int generate_symbols_mccdma(unsigned char* txBits, int bitsPerSymbol,
		int howManySymbols, int spreadFactor, double* txSymI, double* txSymQ)

	void spread_symbols(double* sigI, double* sigQ, char* pnSeq, int len)

	void decode_symbols_mccdma(double* rxSymI, double* rxSymQ, int howManySymbols,


3. Please make sure you have the latest version of "gcc"

4. Compile with command line:
	make

5. Excute with command line.
	./L1_mccdma 2 5000 8
   E.g.: 2 means QPSK. 5000 is blocknumber, more takes more time but more accurated. 8 is spreadFactor.
   Your result will store in a .txt file in result folder.

6. Plot your graph with any tools you like(e.g. Python ...)
